C# matrix project
Objective: fill a n x m matrix by simulating movements from the Knight chess piece. 
The knight move is unusual among chess pieces. When it moves, it can move two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. 
The complete move therefore looks like the letter 'L'.
